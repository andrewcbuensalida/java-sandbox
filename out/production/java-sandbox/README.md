======================================================

JVM (Java Virtual Machine) runs the app. It is in the JRE.
JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is in JDK.
JDK (Java Development Kit). This is what you install. This is not required to run app. Only JRE and JVM are. So as long as a computer has JRE and JVM, it can run any java program.
